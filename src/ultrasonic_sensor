// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This example shows how to use NewPing's ping_timer method which uses the Timer2 interrupt to get the
// ping time. The advantage of using this method over the standard ping method is that it permits a more
// event-driven sketch which allows you to appear to do two things at once. An example would be to ping
// an ultrasonic sensor for a possible collision while at the same time navigating. This allows a
// properly developed sketch to multitask. Be aware that because the ping_timer method uses Timer2,
// other features or libraries that also use Timer2 would be effected. For example, the PWM function on
// pins 3 & 11 on Arduino Uno (pins 9 and 10 on Arduino Mega) and the Tone library. Note, only the PWM
// functionality of the pins is lost (as they use Timer2 to do PWM), the pins are still available to use.
// NOTE: For Teensy/Leonardo (ATmega32U4) the library uses Timer4 instead of Timer2.
